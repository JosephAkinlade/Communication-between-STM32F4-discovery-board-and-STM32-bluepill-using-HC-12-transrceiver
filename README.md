# Communication-between-STM32F4-discovery-board-and-STM32-bluepill-using-HC-12-transrceiver
In this program, the STM32F4 sends a message to the STM32 bluepill and the timestamp when the message is sent is recorded, the STM32 bluepill responds with a message too and the 
timestamp when the message is received is also recorded. The time difference can be used to have an idea of the distance between the two MCUs
